\description{
CMS publishes yearly final rules that detail annual price increases across 
various sectors of healthcare spending. In order to analyze spending
increases due to utilization changes, it is frequently useful to "deflate"
spending based on a reference period, so that observed changes are not due to
inflation.
}
\details{
Most sectors come from annual Federal Register Final Rules. Example:
\href{https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/index.html}{Physician Fee Change Rules}.

Exceptions are \code{other}, which uses the general CPI deflator, and
\code{part_d_drugs}, which use the CPI-Pharmaceutical deflator.`
}
\examples{
# convert $100 in current inpatient spending to year 2005 dollars
price_deflate(100, "ip", 2014, 2005) 
}
